This repository has a collection of scripts for maintaining Windows systems.
It isn't meant to be a complete toolkit, but rather a set of tools that I had
to make myself because I couldn't find them anywhere else (or didn't want to
pay for them).

I leave them here primarily so I can find and reuse them myself, but you're
welcome to use them too. Just be aware that they are neither refined nor
extensively tested, so use at your own risk.
